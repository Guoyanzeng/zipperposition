- make multiset comparison fast
- maybe implement context trees for general purpose indexing
- fast LPO (using paper)
- LRU cache (rather than flush when full)

- efficient rewriting by given confluent terminating TRS
- dedicated structure for rewriting (adaptive automata?)
- storage and detection of axiom schemes (cf Waldmeister) to detect theories -> associate ordering+TRS
- superposition modulo rewriting

- miniscoping in CNF reduction
- simplification rules from clause to clause list
- elimination rules in delayed as simplifications (cf prev. item)
- find better heuristics for delayed superposition
- syntactic tautology deletion?
- more profiling/statistics

- output dedukti code (or even Coq code?)
- graphviz output for data structures and proof
