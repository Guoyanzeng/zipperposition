- make multiset comparison fast
- improve efficiency of discrimination trees: either
    use compressed tries, or use some kind of patricia trees
- only index, and use in inferences, closed terms (otherwise db(n) = foo
    will be used for rewriting, which makes no sense)
- object-oriented pretty-printers, with imperative interfaces, to
    allow to change parameters easily...
