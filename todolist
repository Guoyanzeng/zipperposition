- make multiset comparison fast
- maybe implement context trees for general purpose indexing
- maybe ordering that take a substitution (more efficiently than just applying subst)

- efficient rewriting by given confluent terminating TRS
- dedicated structure for rewriting (adaptive automata?)
- storage and detection of axiom schemes (cf Waldmeister) to detect theories
    -> associate ordering+TRS
    -> associate interesting lemma (learned before)
    -> restarts after theories have been detected during search?
- superposition modulo rewriting

- miniscoping in CNF reduction (even in formulas?)
- find better heuristics for delayed superposition
- syntactic tautology deletion?
- more profiling/statistics

- output dedukti code (or even Coq code?)
