- make multiset comparison fast
- improve efficiency of trie by replacing map by array
    (better for small maps with unfrequent updates)
- fix incompleteness-inducing bugs

- for the "superposition and equivalence reasoning and delayed CNF" paper:
    * implement RPO because = has a multiset status
    * for RPO, implement a 2-elems multiset comparison function
    * combination of total orders to build the precedence
    * stable extension of an ordering (to insert skolem constants under De Bruijn)
    * special inferences for quantifier rules (to introduce skolem constants or variables)
    * special rewriting rule for De Bruijn substitution (also useful for lambda terms)
