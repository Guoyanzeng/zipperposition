- make multiset comparison fast
- improve efficiency of discrimination trees: either use compressed tries, or use some kind of patricia trees
- maybe implement context trees for general purpose indexing
- fingerprint indexing
- hashconsing from why3 (less overhead)?
- simplify : clause -> clause list (for elimination rules in delayed, also for redundancy)
- find better heuristics for delayed superposition
- output dedukti code (or even Coq code?)
