- make multiset comparison fast
- improve efficiency of discrimination trees: either
    use compressed tries, or use some kind of patricia trees

- for the "superposition and equivalence reasoning and delayed CNF" paper:
    * implement RPO because = has a multiset status
    * for RPO, implement a fast 2-elems multiset comparison function
    * insertion of skolem constants in the precedence, under the DeBruijn symbols but
        without modifying the previous precedence
    * special inferences for quantifier rules (to introduce skolem constants or variables)
    * special rewriting rule for De Bruijn substitution (also useful for lambda terms)
