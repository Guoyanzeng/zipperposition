- make multiset comparison fast
- improve efficiency of discrimination trees: either
    use compressed tries, or use some kind of patricia trees
- object-oriented pretty-printers, with imperative interfaces, to
    allow to change parameters easily...
- parsing of axiom files relative to the problem file
- simple CNF reduction not to depend on eprover for superposition
- study whether demodulation on bool terms can be compatible with completeness of delayed superposition
