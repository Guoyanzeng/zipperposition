- make multiset comparison fast
- improve efficiency of discrimination trees: either
    use compressed tries, or use some kind of patricia trees
- write delayed inference rules rather than using axioms, because
    axioms rewrite everywhere in the term, whereas inferences
    should only occur at root.
- add some rules for negation
- object-oriented pretty-printers, with imperative interfaces, to
    allow to change parameters easily...
