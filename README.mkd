# Zipperposition

## Short summary
Zipperposition is intended to be a superposition prover for full first order logic. The accent
is on flexibility, modularity and simplicity rather than performance, to allow
quick experimenting on automated theorem proving. It generates TSTP proofs, but I
don't have a proof checker yet so the proofs may be totally wrong.

Zipperposition is written in the functional language [OCaml](http://caml.inria.fr). The name is
a bad play on the words "zipper" (a functional data structure) and "superposition" (the calculus
used by the prover). Superposition-based theorem proving is an active field of research, so
there is a lot of literature about it; for this implementation my references are the chapter
_paramodulation-based theorem proving_ of the _handbook of automated reasoning_, and the
paper "E: a brainiac theorem prover" that describes the [E](http://eprover.org) prover.

## Build
You will need ocaml (3.12 or higher works; 3.11 or lower may work, I did not test). Type

    make

It should build files (using ocamlbuild).


## Use

Typical usage:

    ./prover3.sh problem_file [options]

or

    ./prover.sh problem_file [options]

to run the prover. Help is available with the option *-help*. The scripts `prover3.sh`
and `prover.sh` call the external prover [E](http://eprover.org) for reduction to CNF;
the former is for [TPTP3](http://tptp.org) syntax, and the latter for old TPTP syntax.

For instance,

    ./prover3.sh pelletier_problems/pb23.p -timeout 5


*Disclaimer*: Note that the prover is currently an early prototype and is
likely not correct nor complete.
