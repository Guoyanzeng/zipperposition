% Problem  : The friends puzzle - reflexivity for Peter's wife
% Version  : [Ben09] axioms.
% English  : (i) Peter is a friend of John, so if Peter knows that John knows
%            something then John knows that Peter knows the same thing. 
%            (ii) Peter is married, so if Peter’s wife knows something, then
%            Peter knows the same thing. John and Peter have an appointment,
%            let us consider the following situation: (a) Peter knows the time
%            of their appointment. (b) Peter also knows that John knows the
%            place of their appointment. Moreover, (c) Peter’s wife knows that
%            if Peter knows the time of their appointment, then John knows
%            that too (since John and Peter are friends). Finally, (d) Peter
%            knows that if John knows the place and the time of their
%            appointment, then John knows that he has an appointment. From
%            this situation we want to prove (e) that each of the two friends
%            knows that the other one knows that he has an appointment.
