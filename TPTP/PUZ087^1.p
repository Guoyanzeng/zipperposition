% Problem  : Wise men puzzle
% Version  : [Ben09] axioms.
% English  : Once upon a time, a king wanted to find the wisest out of his
%            three wisest men. He arranged them in a circle and told them that
%            he would put a white or a black spot on their foreheads and that
%            one of the three spots would certainly be white. The three wise
%            men could see and hear each other but, of course, they could not
%            see their faces reflected anywhere. The king, then, asked to each
%            of them to Ô¨Ånd out the colour of his own spot. After a while, the
%            wisest correctly answered that his spot was white.
