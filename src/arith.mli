(** {6 Arithmetic Manipulations}
  
    This module contains builtin knownledge about (linear) arithmetic
    with the TPTP syntax and semantic. It mainly deals with two topics:

    - simplification (evaluation) of arithmetic terms/propositions
    - extraction of single subterms from (in)equations
*)

(** {2 Terms} *)

module T : sig
  val sum_list : Term.t list -> Term.t
    (** Sum of those terms *)

  val is_arith : Term.t -> bool
    (** Is the term arithmetic? *)

  val simplify : signature:Signature.t -> Term.t -> Term.t
    (** Arithmetic simplifications *)
end

(** {2 Polynomes of order 1, over several variables}.

    Variables, in this module, are non-arithmetic terms, i.e. non-interpreted
    functions and predicates, that occur immediately under an arithmetic
    operator. For instance, in the term "f(X) + 1 + 3 Ã— a", the variables
    are "f(X)" and "a", with coefficients "1" and "3".

  val product : t -> Symbol.t -> t  (** Product with constant *)

    This module provides a given view of a literal, where some arith variable
    has been extracted *)

  | L_lesseq of Term.t * Monome.t
  | R_less of Monome.t * Term.t
  | R_lesseq of Monome.t * Term.t

  val is_arith : Literal.t -> bool
    (** Is this literal arithmetic (i.e., root predicate is equality or
        inequality, with arithmetic operators just underneath)? *)

  val extract : Literal.t -> t list
    (** Possible views of a literal *)

end

(** {2 Other transformations} *)

val purify : ord:Ordering.t -> Literal.t array -> Literal.t array
  (** Purify the literals, by replacing arithmetic terms that occur
      under a non-interpreted predicate of formula, by a fresh variable,
      and adding the constraint variable=arith subterm to the literals. *)
