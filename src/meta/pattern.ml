(** The datalog provers reasons over first-order formulas. However, to make
    those formulas signature-independent, we curryfy them and abstract their
    symbols into lambda-bound variables.

    This way, the pattern for "f(X,Y)=f(Y,X)"
    is "\F. ((= @ ((F @ x) @ y)) @ ((F @ y) @ x))" *)

type pattern = term * varlist
  (** A pattern is a curryfied formula, along with a list of variables
      whose order matters. *)
