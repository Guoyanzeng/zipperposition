(** {1 Polynomes of order 1, over several variables}.

    Variables, in this module, are non-arithmetic terms, i.e. non-interpreted
    functions and predicates, that occur immediately under an arithmetic
    operator. For instance, in the term "f(X) + 1 + 3 Ã— a", the variables
    are "f(X)" and "a", with coefficients "1" and "3".

    Monomes of integers {b must} satisfy the property that each
    coefficient is divisible by the [divby] field.
