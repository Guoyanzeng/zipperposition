(** {1 Polynomes of order 1, over several variables}.

    Variables, in this module, are non-arithmetic terms, i.e. non-interpreted
    functions and predicates, that occur immediately under an arithmetic
    operator. For instance, in the term "f(X) + 1 + 3 Ã— a", the variables
    are "f(X)" and "a", with coefficients "1" and "3".

    Monomes of integers {b must} satisfy the property that each
    coefficient is divisible by the [divby] field.

      The intuition is that this returns [true] iff the monome, with its
      denominator [divby], actually has some instances in its type. Trivially
      true in reals or rationals, this is only the case for integers if
      [x * m.divby = m.coeffs + m.constant] is a satisfiable diophantine
      equation.

val total_expression : t -> bool
  (** For real or rationals, always true. For integers, returns true
      iff the monome evaluates to an integer for any valuation of free
      variables and terms that occur in the right hand side. Most of
      the time, it means that the denominator is 1.
      
      For instance, a/2 is not a total expression, 3 + 5Y is total,
      but (3Y+7/5) has instances without being total. *)

  val eq_zero : ?fresh_var:(Type.t -> FOTerm.t) -> t -> solution list

        for diophantine equations. Returns the empty list if no solution is
        found.
