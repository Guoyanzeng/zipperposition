(** {1 Basic Splitting Ã  la Avatar}

    We don't implement all the stuff from Avatar, in particular all clauses are
    active whether or not their trail is satisfied in the current model.
    Trails are only used to make splits easier {b currently}.

    Future work may include locking clauses whose trails are unsatisfied.

    Depends on the "meta" extension.
