These inductive problems have been manually translated from the file
[[https://github.com/verifast/verifast/blob/master/bin/list.gh][list.gh]] from Verifast standard library.

Usage: $ make | grep -v make

The definitions of the inductive datatype of lists and of some
recursive functions on lists are in file [[./list.zf][list.zf]]. The various lemmas
are listed in file [[./goals.org][goals.org]]. For each lemma =foo=, the [[./Makefile][Makefile]] generates
two problems:
- =foo_hard_pb.zf=: prove lemma =foo= from the definitions only,
- =foo_easy_pb.zf=: prove lemma =foo= from the definitions and assuming all previous lemmas.
