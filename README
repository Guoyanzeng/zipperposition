This is intended to be a superposition prover for full first order logic. The accent
is on flexibility, modularity and simplicity rather than performance, to allow
quick experimenting on automated theorem proving. It may at some point generate
proofs.

Some files come from matita, the TPTP parser/lexer are from Darwin, the hashcons
module comes from Jean-Christophe Filli√¢tre. Since all of them are under GPL,
the present software is also under GPLv2.
